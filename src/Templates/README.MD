# Pawsy Templates

For any of these templates simply navigate to the template's folder and run `dotnet new install .` to install the template.

## Example

For the Module template navigate to `Templates/Module` and run `dotnet new install .` this will add the template **PawsyModule** to dotnet. You can create a new folder wherever you want your module to be but the template expects it to be under `PawsyModules/<YourModuleNameHere>`. From there simply run `dotnet new PawsyModule` inside that folder you created to copy all the needed files and automatically rename a few variables after your folder.
